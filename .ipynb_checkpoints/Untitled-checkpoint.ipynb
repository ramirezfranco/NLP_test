To fix this problem , he believes schools must treat studentsâ €™ racial and socioeconomic status as assets rather than deficits , something he feels that the public school system does not always do . Born and raised in El Pasoâ €” and Latino like the majority of his pupilsâ €” Yanar is a social entrepreneur on a mission . â € œStudents will make the decision to attend college in seventh grade , â €\\x9d he says . â € œThat decision is largely based on reading level , but their success depends on how socially and emotionally prepared they are . â €\\x9d Students who are significantly behind in their reading when they enter sixth gradeâ €” which the majority of EPLAâ €™ s students areâ €” have a higher statistical likelihood of being incarcerated than attending college . Yanar seeks to reverse this trend . â € œWhat drives my passion is ensuring low - income Latino students have the same shot at success as their middle - and high - income counterparts , â €\\x9d he says . Inspired by his professors , Yanar developed what would become EPLAâ €™ s core values : collaboration , responsibility , smarts , humility , and hunger . His culturally responsive curriculum encourages well - rounded leadership : â € œOur students learn to view their race or background as an asset rather than a deficit . We empower them with a curriculum that connects with their culture . â €\\x9d Yanarâ €™ s plans began to take shape in earnest when he cross - registered for a class at Harvard Graduate School of Education with senior lecturer Katherine Merseth , an expert on charter schools . Combining the lessons he learned at HGSE and HKS , Yanar began what would become his 288 - page charter , the schoolâ €™ s foundational document . Yanar also had the good luck to meet Andrew Benitez , a fellow El Pasoan and Harvard College student who was equally passionate about education , at a Latino get - together at the John F . Kennedy Jr . Forum . Benitez co - founded EPLA with Yanar and is now the schoolâ €™ s principal . The odds of starting EPLA were not good . Not only did Yanar have to refine his charter and register as a nonprofit organization , but he faced the lengthy process of applying with the Texas Education Agency , which grants charter school status . In 2013 , EPLA was one of only three successful applicants from an initial pool of more than 80 . The hard work continued after Yanar set up the school , aided by a charter school start - up grant and private donations and loans . Yanar recalls the dozens of jobs he took on at the beginning , including mopping the floors occasionally . In addition to building his model of leadership and his curriculum , Yanar directed day - to - day operations at first . He relied on the skills he learned at HKS for these tasks : â € œNegotiation skills , regression analysis , and ethicsâ €” I studied all of these at the Kennedy School and use them now . â €\\x9d Yanar is not only interested in teaching leadership skills , but he hopes to serve as a model of leadership by example . â € œI myself am in a statistically minute group of people , â €\\x9d he explains . â € œI say this not as a point of pride but as a point of concern . I am one of only a few Latino charter school founders or CEOs in the country . But by serving as CEO , I can show our kids that it is possible . They can and must become CEOs too . â €\\x9d Even now , Yanar is seeing results as his first students enter high school and are excelling . â € œWe have turned these kidsâ €™ lives around , â €\\x9d Yanar says . â € œThey are exemplars in our community . â €\\x9d He is proud of the fact that the question many of them face now is not whether they will go to college , but where . â €” Images courtesy of Omar Yanar | El Paso Leadership AcademyqPXP \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / research - insights / policy - topics / human - rights - justiceqQXä \\x04\\x00\\x00 Bryan Stevenson MPP / JD 1985 worked for decades to bring justice via the courtroom .

Social , economic , technological , and demographic shifts have changed menâ €™ s attitudes about , and engagement in , their role as parents .

But the role of race to native born and newcomer alike has been treated often as aberrational , an unfortunate artifact of the nationâ €™ s past . Over the past 40 years , women have made significant advancements in narrowing the gender gap across a number of prestigious careers that were formerly dominated by men . But women are stillÂ 37 percent less likely than men to graduate with degrees in science or engineering and only account for 25 percent of the science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM ) workforce . q \\\\ X {\\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / research - insights / policy - topics / public - leadership - management / performance - specialists - governmentq ] X (\\x00\\x00 Governor Gina Raimondo had just taken office , inheriting a troubled child welfare agency $ 16 million over budget and with a higher percentage of children in group care settings than almost any state in the country . An audit would reveal that the agency was signing away tens of millions of dollars without financial controls or oversight and was producing poor outcomes for the children and families in its care . â € œWhen I took office , the Department of Children , Youth and Families faced a number of significant operations and budget challenges that had to be addressed quickly so that we could provide better outcomes for our children , â €\\x9d Raimondo says . â € œI knew that Jeff had started an organization at the Kennedy School that could actually send staff to come work full - time , pro bono on the ground supporting transformational initiatives . I asked him to send as many people as he could . â €\\x9d Liebman had founded the Government Performance Lab in 2011 after serving in leadership roles at President Obamaâ €™ s Office of Management and Budget . The GPLâ €™ s mission is to help state and local leaders make progress on social problems by improving the way governments contract for and manage social services . The GPL developed a hands - on model of research , embedding staff in government agencies to provide technical assistance . These team members , including many HKS alums , typically work with an agency for one to two years to help develop , test , and implement innovative management strategies . â €” Â â € œI thought I was going to do a few small projects and then get back to regular teaching and research , â €\\x9d Liebman says . But he discovered there was enormous appetite for the type of data - driven , boots - on - the - ground technical assistance his fledgling team could provide . Before the first PFS project had even launched , 25 more governments had applied for assistance . Liebman began building a staff with backgrounds in data analysis , public policy , and implementation , and placing them in the field with governments selected through national competitions . Over the next few years , the GPL helped launch 12 of the countryâ €™ s first 18 PFS projects , including initiatives in maternal and infant health , high - quality pre - K , and homelessness , expanding over $ 135 million in preventative services to more than 20 , 000 individuals . In 2016 and 2017 , the GPL invited applications from governments seeking assistance with high - priority initiatives and was overwhelmed by responses . Raising over $ 22 million in grant funding , the GPL expanded at a breathtaking paceâ €” today it is a 45 - person organization and has worked with 65 governments in 31 states . â € œWe began to see common challenges across governments , â €\\x9d says GPL Program Director Danielle Cerny MPP 2014 . â € œThey have talented staff but are so consumed with putting out fires and keeping things running that they donâ €™ t have the capacity to strategically connect their daily activities with their long - term goals . Are there high - needs individuals that they ought to be reaching who are not connected to services or have fallen through the cracks ? Are the services the agency inherited actually the ones that their clients need ? How can they use real - time data to improve the outcomes they get from their providers ? Working across jurisdictions has allowed us to develop a set of approaches that responds to the recurring issues we see governments grappling with . â €\\x9d Liebman and his growing team have become experts at using analytics , outcomes - focused contracts , and cross - sector collaborations to help improve social service programs . The GPL helps governments address thorny questions , like how to use data to find individuals who had fallen through the cracks , or how to restructure contracts to incentivize providers to serve the most difficult clients . â € œFrom these initial projects , it became clear that the best way to figure out how to help governments administer and manage programs better is to try it out . These hands - on engagements are where the best new ideas for public sector management are going to come from , â €\\x9d Liebman says . â € œAnd once our government partners see the value of having a change agent on their team , they often create positions to hire our fellows directly after our formal technical assistance comes to an end . Our work lets us train a new generation of passionate public servants and connect them to governments that are hungry for talent . â €\\x9d Â RESULTS - DRIVEN CONTRACTING Through the initiative , Seattle applied for help on its homelessness contracts . Over the course of a decade , the cityâ €™ s budget for homelessness services had almost doubled to $ 50 million , but homelessness was still increasing at 13 percent every year . â € œWe had 168 contracts with homelessness service providers , but we couldnâ €™ t tell if they were adding up to actual progress , â €\\x9d says Tyler Running Deer , the cityâ €™ s former organizational performance director . â € œWe needed more detailed data and more frequent data review points . It was clear that it wasnâ €™ t just a question of spending more money , but spending it smarter . â €\\x9d The GPL helped the city simplify and streamline the contracts around a core set of metrics related to the outcomes the city cared most aboutâ €” whether individuals were progressing to stable housing situations rather than cycling back into homelessness . Those new metrics are allowing the city to measure progress in real time and implement data - focused collaborations between service providers and agency staff that are improving performance . â € œIn homelessness , the challenge is often overcoming a perpetual crisis state in order to focus on preventative and long - term solutions , â €\\x9d says Tyler Jaeckel MPP 2013 , the program director who leads the GPLâ €™ s homelessness and behavioral health practice . â € œOur homelessness projects in Seattle , Denver , and Massachusetts take innovative approaches to addressing the crisis and develop new methods for shifting resources to solutions that are likely to generate lasting change . â €\\x9d Â RHODE ISLAND TURNAROUND The contract overview laid the groundwork for mapping services against needs and pinpointing areas where interventions were missing or where an approach needed to be reimagined . When the agency asked for assistance with the reprocurement of nearly $ 100 million in core services ( about 40 percent of the agencyâ €™ s budget ), it became an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and find new service delivery solutions . GPL staff fanned out across the state , talking with dozens of nonprofit service providers and agency social workers , elevating often overlooked perspectives from the service frontlines . Eschewing traditional â € œcut and pasteâ €\\x9d contract renewals , Kleimanâ €™ s team then helped DCYF structure a multi - part â € œproblem - basedâ €\\x9d procurement that engaged a broad set of stakeholders in proposing solutions to the challenges the agency was trying to solve . At the time , Rhode Island was close to worst in the nation in the percentage of children in its care in group homes rather than with foster families or relatives . Â The agency noted that children with clinical needs were often being sent to placement in group homes . At the agencyâ €™ s first - provider summit , the GPL asked nonprofit service providers to brainstorm alternative interventions . Providers suggested an evidence - based model from Oregon that provided high - intensity support for foster families taking in children with behavioral challenges . So when the agency was still seeing children with clinical needs linger in group care , Active Contract Management provided the structure to bring the agency and service providers together to try to tease out what was happening , says GPL fellow Alice Heath MPP 2016 . â € œDigging into the data , we learned that many kids would have their clinical needs met but then would hit administrative barriers that created lengthy delays to placement with a foster family , â €\\x9d Heath says . â € œThat was a new insight for the agency that helped change the way they targeted their efforts to make sure as many kids as possible were in homes with a family . â €\\x9d With the GPLâ €™ s help , the department launched a pilot to meet with families early in a childâ €™ s group home placement to determine strategies to better prepare them for a move to a foster family . â € œOur GPL colleagues bring new perspectives to our work , â €\\x9d says DCYF Director Trista Piccola . â € œWhether implementing an Active Contract Management structure with our community providers or helping our team align our contracting processes , their help has been invaluable . Change is one of the most difficult issues faced by large systems like ours , and GPL has helped us create positive , lasting change for our stateâ €™ s children and families . â €\\x9d The results of the GPLâ €™ s engagements thus far are impressive . During the GPLâ €™ s time in Rhode Island , the share of foster children in group homes declined 29 percent , the volume of contracted foster homes rose 63 percent , and the number of children in out - of - state institutional care dropped 44 percent . At the governorâ €™ s request , the GPL has embedded fellows with eight other state agencies and led over 100 state agency staff in trainings . In 2017 , Seattle announced that it would utilize the results - driven contracting framework it had piloted with the GPL in a procurement for $ 30 million in homelessness services . Jurisdictions that initially reached out to the GPL for assistance with a PFS contract are now applying the data - driven principles they learned to core services . For example , Connecticutâ €™ s Department of Children and Families , which worked with the GPL on a $ 12 million project improving services for families dealing with substance abuse , is now working with GPL fellow Matthew Tyler MPP 2017 to transform the way it connects families and children to services . As it nears its seventh anniversary , the GPL is poised for even greater impact . â € œWe have far more governments asking us for help than we have the resources to serve , â €\\x9d says Liebman . â € œOur focus going forward is on continuing to do innovative projects that generate new solutions while also finding cost - effective ways to spread the solutions we have already demonstrated . â €\\x9d â €” Photo by Martha Stewartq ^ X ~\\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / research - insights / policy - topics / business - regulation / partners - growth - andrew - deye - mcmpa - 2015 - workingq_XY !\\x00\\x00 THINK OF SEATTLE , AND WHAT COMES TO MIND ?

Seattle , after all , wasnâ €™ t always Seattle . In 1971 , unemployment was 13 percent , and the economy was more steel and lumber than digital and coffee . A NEW PATH After graduating from college , Deye beat the well - worn path to Wall Street to work for Morgan Stanley . It was the usual investment bank / Wall Street route , but with an important difference . He had interned at the White Houseâ €™ s National Economic Council , and it had changed his thinking . â € œThe experience opened my eyes to the power of principled leadership and smart public policy , â €\\x9d he says . So he dove into the growing field of public - private partnerships ( also known as P3 ), working on projects such as infrastructure , utilities , and energy , where the two sectors intersected . â € œBy 2013 , I was a vice president at an investment bank in Chicago , Greenhill , â €\\x9d Deye says . â € œWith that role came fascinating client work . But in my early 30s I consistently wondered , Should I continue on a traditional corporate path ? Or was it time to chart a new path and move back to my home state of Ohio ? â €\\x9d JobsOhio , created in 2011 by Republican Governor John Kasich and the Ohio legislature , was the perfect fit . It performed the sort of economic development that for decades had been carried out by a government department , which leaders in Ohio thought was up for a reboot . The government retained certain functions , but the core of the economic development piece was privatized and spun off into a new entity . Six regional economic development groups , with which JobsOhio collaborates , create further direct links to local officials . â € œYou had a state government unit that existed for nearly 50 years , and there had been a sea change in business over that time , â €\\x9d Deye says . â € œHad the state programs kept up ? Probably not . Had customer service kept up ? Probably not . â €\\x9d The state recruited a Silicon Valley venture capitalist to start JobsOhio in 2011 and set the organization on its path . A corporate board that reflected a focus on P3 was created , with prominent leaders from business and higher education overseeing the organization . To insulate it from the ups and downs of state funding cycles ( in downturns , economic development budgets are usually among the first on the chopping block ), a bond issue in 2013 allowed JobsOhio to purchase a 25 - year franchise on the stateâ €™ s liquor profits , giving it budget security . JobsOhio utilizes this now - private funding to fulfill its purpose of creating jobs and improving economic well - being . More than a dozen industry experts were recruited to talk to people from those industries as peers . The idea , Deye explains , is to sell the business opportunity , not the government incentive . â € œIn that peer - to - peer model , we want to actually compete on the basis of our business knowledge , â €\\x9d he says . â € œOn â €˜ Hey , hereâ €™ s a good place for your supply chain , â €™ or â €˜ Hereâ €™ s a good site for your business , â €™ not â €˜ Here \\' s how much incentive we can give you . â €™ Because incentives are a small part of the overall decision of where to put your manufacturing plant or new office space . â €\\x9d The focus has been on growth in nine industries , including energy , automotive , aerospace , financial services , biotechnology , and information technology . Cross - sector strategies focus on areas where those industries can create new opportunities together : for example , financial services and information technology can help increase the stateâ €™ s fintech footprint . AN EMPTY PLANT Deye does not accept the term Rust Belt . He argues that it unfairly locks a whole region into a narrative that is out - of - date and is a term that never recognized the areaâ €™ s economic diversity in the first place . But if there is a narrative , the closing automobile plant is a stock character . And in 2008 , General Motors closed its assembly plant in Moraine , Ohio , where Chevrolet Trailblazers and other SUVs were made . More than 2 , 400 workers were idle and a massive facility was left empty . Working with industry experts , Deye explains , JobsOhio strove to make the facility attractive for redevelopment . In 2014 , Fuyao Glass , a Chinese company and one of the worldâ €™ s largest auto glass producers , bought the plant , and in 2015 , the first products , including car windshields , started coming off the production line . The plant now employs more than 2 , 000 workers . â €” Â Two hundred miles to the east , in Belmont County , JobsOhio invested more than $ 20 million to flatten and grade a former coal plant to make it more attractive to a company looking to build an ethane crackerâ €” a sort of petrochemical plantâ €” that could become a multi - billion investment in the area . In northeast Ohio , JobsOhio helped finance a natural gas pipeline that connects the area to a dependable ( and more environmentally friendly ) supply of energy . That access to natural gas means the area can now attract factories and facilities . Hamilton , Ohio , in the southeastern corner of the state , like other towns along the Great Miami River Valley , was once an important manufacturing center , making engines and paper and automobile parts . JobsOhio has helped the town bounce back after those industries faded . Barclays , the financial group , has opened a 1 , 000 - person customer service center . And a German company , Thyssen Krupp , has opened an auto parts operation . â € œThere are three key things companies want to know when they \\' re thinking about where to invest : speed , risk , and cost , â €\\x9d Deye explains . â € œCan you help me do it faster ? Can you help me do it with lower risk ? And can you help me reduce the cost of doing it ? So most of the programs we offer as JobsOhio address those three issues . As with the properties weâ €™ ve helped revitalize , those companies are not going to wait years to have an old site remediated . Weâ €™ ll help do that for them . â €\\x9d Those revitalization and transformation projects are not initiated just by new companies . JobsOhio solicits input from the regional development partners , along with existing stakeholders , before deciding what to fund . Its focus isnâ €™ t only attracting major industrial players and multinationals . About 80 percent of its work is with small and medium - sized businesses , either start - ups or fast - growing companies looking for somewhere to grow . And the organizationâ €™ s focus is also statewide , so it can boast of having activity in all 88 of Ohioâ €™ s counties , in both rural and urban areas . A NEW STORY JobsOhio has not been without its critics . Opponents of the nonprofit have pointed to its lack of transparency , for example . Some public officials , including the state auditor , have called for a more open view of the organization \\' s books . Supporters of JobsOhio , including Governor Kasich , have said that public oversight can create burdens and delays that go directly against the grain of the nonprofitâ €™ s nimble approach . Deye adds that having been only recently created , JobsOhio is regularly explaining its unique operating model . He points to its high transparency rating by GuideStar , the nonprofit information service . And he points to the numbers : More than $ 38 billion in capital investments and more than $ 30 billion in combined new and retained payrolls . The $ 169 million put by JobsOhio into revitalization projects has leveraged an additional $ 2 billion in investments . And JobsOhio has worked hard to bring the message to the outside world , both domestically and internationally . Domestically , he says , the stateâ €™ s economic turnaround is increasingly known . Ohio , as Deye can tell you , has the countryâ €™ s 7th largest economy and the 21st largest globally . Its fiscal discipline , including a $ 2 . 7 billion reserve , has given it a strong AA bond rating . The state is home to 57 Fortune 1000 companies , more than 70 NYSE - listed companies , and nearly 50 NASDAQ companies . â € œThat evolution from being among the worst ranked states for business to being in the top 10â €” that \\' s another big part of the story , â €\\x9d Deye says . â € œItâ €™ s a meaningful part of what we do . â €\\x9d â €” Photos courtesy of JobsOhioq ` X4 \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / more / alumni / hks - magazineqaX >\\x02\\x00\\x00 Stevenson is the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative .

The trade dispute between the worldâ €™ s two largest economies escalated further this week ( September 24 ) when the United States imposed tariffs on $ 200 billion in goods . China is expected to retaliate by placing tariffs on $ 60 billion on American goods . The American tariffs come on top of $ 50 billion imposed earlier in the year . The Trump administration has pointed to Chinaâ €™ s unfair policies relating to U . S . technology and intellectual property . â € œThese practices plainly constitute a grave threat to the long - term health and prosperity of the United States economy , â €\\x9d President Donald Trump said in announcing the tariffs . â € œFor months , we have urged China to change these unfair practices , and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies . Â We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made , and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly . But , so far , China has been unwilling to change its practices . â €\\x9d Robert Lawrence , Albert L . Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at Harvard Kennedy School , sees a different explanation for the Trump administrationâ €™ s trade policies . Â Trump has justified the tariffs as measures designed to pressure China to stop its unfair trade practices such as cyber theft of trade secrets , failing to enforce the intellectual property rights of U . S . firms , and using market access as a means of forcing technology transfer . Not surprisingly , this explanation has struck a chord with Americans who agree that such Chinese policies are a problem and who interpret Trumpâ €™ s actions as a temporary negotiating ploy that will achieve fair and free trade in the long run . Indeed this seems to be the view that has allowed the stock market to remain strong . It is also common to read interviews with his supporters who have been hurt by Chinese retaliation on products such as soybeans in which they say they are prepared to make sacrifices and endure the short - term losses because eventually China will be forced to change its policies . But there is good reason to be suspicious of this interpretation of Trumpâ €™ s actions . After all , if there is one thing Trump has made clear , it is that he believes that when U . S . firms outsource production to countries such China , American workers lose the jobs he has vowed to protect . Recall , for example , how Trump lashed outÂ at American companies that outsourced manufacturing to Mexico . Yet suppose that the Chinese agree to comply with U . S . complaints and agree to change practices that restrict foreign investment , weaken intellectual property protection , and force firms to transfer their technologies to local firms as a condition for selling in the Chinese market . Surely , this would make China a more attractive location for U . S . companies who are thinking of offshoring their production . Â Inconsistency is not exactly unusual when it comes to Trumpâ €™ s behavior . And it is always possible that Trump could reach a settlement with China that he would portray as a victory . Â Â But there is a much more plausible interpretation of these actions : These tariffs are not a temporary negotiating ploy ; they are the measures Trump has long wanted to permanently put in place to punish American corporations that use Chinese workers to produce the products they sell in the United States , and to protect U . S . jobs . In 2011 , he wrote a book in which he vowed to place tariffs of 25 percent on imports from China and during the campaign he again promised to tax the products that are produced abroad and imported to the United States by American multinationals . And that is exactly what he had done , and it is also why the administrationâ €™ s goals in these negotiations with China have never been made clear . Â The presidentâ €™ s policies are a tragedy because they have also undermined Americaâ €™ s leadership role . The problems presented by Chinaâ €™ s protectionist policies and weak enforcement of intellectual property rights could have been dealt with through measures that would have been consistent with the role of the United States as the leader of the rules - based trading system rather than its greatest threat . Instead of alienating its allies by using the pretext of national security to impose tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports ( and further threatening to impose tariffs on their automotive exports ), the United States should have joined with its allies to put pressure on China to conform to WTO rules where these are applicable and to negotiate new rules that are better suited to the challenges the Chinese economy presents . But like many American presidents who have involved Americans in real wars , Trump seems to have launched this war without a clear end game . As a result , rather than inflicting temporary harm in the name of greater good , the measures are more likely to remain in place for a long time . The apologists who believe we have to endure plummeting soybean prices and higher costs for the goods we consume so that Trump can achieve fair trade are going to be sorely disappointed . The reality is that he is a protectionist whose ill - considered policies will do considerable damage to our economy and the manufacturing workers and farmers he claims to care about . qjX ]\\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / research - insights / policy - topics / gender - race - identity / qa - zoe - marksqkX ° \\x00\\x00 New faculty member Zoe Marks on violence , contradictions , and unexpected intimacy of conflict and its aftermath . Â Â This year Iâ €™ m teaching a course called â € œAfrica in Global Politics . â €\\x9d The most important thing students will learn is that Africa is the key to understanding todayâ €™ s global political and economic system and its inequalities . Two major historical occurrences benchmark this : the slave trade , which led to global capitalism ; and African independence , which established the present international state system . But they will also learn that Africaâ €™ s story very much lies in its futureâ €” one in three people on Earth will live in its 54 countries and 10 contested territories by 2100 . Ultimately , listening to African voices and taking the continentâ €™ s political contradictions seriously are essential to understanding its dynamism and uncanny ability to foreshadow global political trends . Â One of the through - lines of my work is examining how power inequalities manifest and multiply . I try to attend to and understand voices and experiences that are systematically excluded in most conflict research . And in academia , Iâ €™ m constantly seeking new tactics to make universities inclusive and equitable . In real - world terms , this is crucial because policies are designed to address events and experiences that have been seen and heard by people with power . If we only ask questions about individual actors , we canâ €™ t develop policies informed by social relationships . If we assume people are inherently violent , we canâ €™ t call on armed groups to adhere to their own laws and principles of restraint . And if we donâ €™ t ask whether there are experts who are not in the room , we overlook opportunities to learn from people on the frontlines . These are some of the ways I try to approach problem solving in my teaching and research . Â At the moment , itâ €™ s probably that I have lived most of my adult life abroadâ €” in five countries and on two continents . ( Perhaps less interesting , but more surprising , is the fact I once appeared in The New York Times style section for my nail polish art , which itself resulted from not being able to carry my paint canvases between all those countries !) Being an immigrant has dramatically shaped my view of politics , race relations , and Americaâ €™ s real or perceived role in the world . Iâ €™ m grateful to be returning home now to pursue justice , equality , and intellectual rigor with a global community I truly cherish . qlX |\\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / research - insights / policy - topics / international - relations - security / remembering - senator - john - mccainqmX “ \\x00\\x00 Harvard Kennedy School Southeast Asia expert Thomas Vallelyâ €” Vietnam War veteran and friend of John McCainâ €” discusses McCainâ €™ s role in normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam . As much of official Washington gathered in the cavernous nave of the Washington National Cathedral earlier this month to pay their final respects to the late Senator John McCain , Harvardâ €™ s Thomas Vallely MC / MPA 1983 stood among former presidents , cabinet secretaries , members of Congress , and military service members to say goodbye to a friend of 30 years with whom he had worked to reshape U . S . policy in Southeast Asia . Â Elected to Congress in 1982 as an Arizona Republican , McCain quickly went to work advocating for the establishment of a U . S . interest section inside the French Embassy in Hanoi . He was pilloried for the idea , but Vallely was intrigued by the proposal . â € œMcCain didn \\' t have a lot of people defending him , but I did , â €\\x9d Vallely said . â € œBecause I defended John , we became friends . That \\' s how we started . â €\\x9d Â Vallely visited Vietnam for the first time since the end of the war not long after McCain had done so . â € œJohn and I were both exploring and learning about Vietnam , both seeking to understand how the two countries could achieve closure from the war and move forward , â €\\x9d he said . Vallelyâ €™ s path took him to Harvard , where after a career in politics in the Massachusetts State House , he was recruited to join the former Harvard Institute of International Development by its then director Dwight Perkins , the Harold Hitchings Burbank Research Professor of Political Economy . Â â € œWith Dwight , we started to think about Vietnam in the context of what HIID had been doing in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and began to ask ourselves , â €˜ How would Vietnam emerge ? â €™ â €\\x9d Vallely helped plant the seeds for what eventually would become the Harvard Vietnam Program , and started developing a firmer understanding of Vietnamâ €™ s political landscape . â € œAt the time there were no diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnamâ €” so there was no embassy , and no political officers or people on the ground in Vietnam who had a knowledge of contemporary Vietnamese politics . We helped fill that void . â €\\x9d As Vallely worked to build the Vietnam Program at Harvard and expand contacts with the senior government leaders there , McCain was elected to the U . S . Senate , where he , along with fellow Vietnam veterans John Kerry , Chuck Hagel , and Bob Kerrey , helped shape the national conversation over normalizing relations with Vietnam . McCain pushed the government in Hanoi to shut down its â € œreeducation campsâ €\\x9d housing prisoners from South Vietnam , give a full accounting of U . S . service members still listed as missing in action or prisoner of war , and take steps to secure a political settlement in neighboring Cambodia . Â Vallely , who has spent the last five years working to transform FETP into Fulbright University Vietnam , the countryâ €™ s first independent not - for - profit institution of higher education , sees this institution as a testament to McCainâ €™ s legacy and commitment to the free expression of thought and ideas . â € œFulbright University encapsulates many of the things that John McCain stood for , â €\\x9d Vallely explains . â € œIt represents the idea of an open society and an open set of ideas without having to say you need to be exactly like the United States . â €\\x9d Â â €” Banner photo by Jason Reed ; Event photo by Sarah GruczaqnXR \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / more / student - life / student - stories / voice - social - justiceqoXÂ \\x00\\x00 Margareta â € œMagdaâ €\\x9d Matacheâ €™ s roots in activism stem from her childhood growing up in a Roma family in post - communist Romania . Magdaâ €™ s community had been enslaved for five centuries ; today , her people continue to be treated as a disenfranchised minority . This sparked her struggle for Roma rights and shaped her conviction in social justice for all . â € œMy passion and my call are very much directed towards rights , respect , dignity and humanity , â €\\x9d says Magda . â € œI hope that my contribution at HKS will translate some of these ideals into actions . â €\\x9d Magda began her career as a community organizer and youth worker in Roma neighborhoods in Bucharest subsequently rising to the position of first female executive director of the Romani Center for Social Intervention and Studies ( Romani CRISS ), a leading Roma nonprofit that ties advocacy and strategic litigation with community intervention . Under her leadership , Romani CRISS won landmark anti - discrimination cases and influenced the passage of education bills promoting diversity and desegregation . Magdaâ €™ s shift from activism to academia resulted from a desire to gain skills and knowledge that would enable her to develop more participatory and better - targeted solutions for the Roma and other minority marginalized groups . â € œAlthough I continue to believe in and apply a bottom - up approach in my work , equally , I recognize the benefit of having strong Roma voices at the highest levels of leadership . We need to catalyze change and shift paradigms in designing , implementing , and monitoring European policies to ensure sustainable social and economic change for the Roma , and why not , create a model of inclusion for minorities in Europe and worldwide . â €\\x9d â € œThe Mid - Career program is a hub for developing substantive relationships with future leaders , alumni and the Harvard community as a whole . Itâ €™ s extremely exciting to be part of a global community whose members can help one another , inspire each other and keep each other accountable in our struggles for global justice . I am honored to be a Mallinckrodt Fellow : The support has not only allowed me to advance my own education , but also to push for conversations about the Roma within the broader HKS community . â €\\x9d Magda is already translating â € œideals into actionâ €\\x9d at HKS . Along with several classmates and the Human Rights professional interest council ( PIC ), she is organizing the first annual human rights symposium in order to create a space for Harvard to strengthen its solidarity and partnership with oppressed communities across the world and for students to stand up for and stand with minority and marginalized groups . Her hope is that future generations of students will build on this initiative and continue its work toward the realization of human rights . She also has her eye on how she can make a difference after she leaves HKS : â € œThe â €˜ Ask What You Can Doâ €™ banner at the entrance of the school is an everyday reminder that what makes one exceptional is not how we enter the doors to HKS , but rather how we exit them : how positively our actions will impact one life or millions of lives , or how our leadership will shift our countries toward peace , global solidarity , inclusion , rights and respect for all people . â €\\x9d qpX >\\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / executive - education - program - finderqqh XW \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / educational - programs / executive - education / program - experienceqrX -\\x04\\x00\\x00 You learn with an extraordinarily international cohort .

Since itâ €™ s by definition multi - departmental and interdisciplinary , it allowed me to pursue creative and interesting work . â €\\x9d qƒXT \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / educational - programs / doctoral - programs / phd - public - policyq „ Xò \\x03\\x00\\x00 The PhD in Public Policy ( PPOL ) program provides the advanced graduate training you need to successfully launch yourself into a research or related position in academia , government , a nongovernmental organization , or the private sector . You will get the trainingÂ you need to conduct analytical research , help shape and execute policy , and teach the next generation of educators , researchers , and practitioners . The program encourages scholarly research that empowers public policy practitioners like you to make informed decisions and be leaders in their fields . The PPOL coursework combines core requirements in theory ( economics , politics and management , and normative theory ) and methods ( advanced methodology , and analytical and quantitative empirical methods ) with primary and secondary concentrations in areas such as : PPOL graduates enter the workplace prepared to teach , research , and make a profound impact in academia , while for others the degreeÂ leads to productive careers in the private sector . q … XT \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / educational - programs / doctoral - programs / phd - health - policyq † XD \\x03\\x00\\x00 The PhD in Health Policy is a highly interdisciplinary program that will develop the specialized skills you need for a research and teaching career in health policy . The program is collaborative at its core , with its curriculum drawing from six Harvard schools : With more than 100 Harvard faculty members from these schools integrated in the program , you have access to the insights of leading experts across the full academic and professional spectrum . As a PhD in Health Policy student , you take courses throughout Harvardâ €™ s specialized schools . This allows you to become familiar with the conceptual frameworks , vernacular and perspectives of researchers from other disciplines . At the same time , developing specialized skills in a discipline is a hallmark of the program , which is why you specialize in one of five concentrations : q ‡ XT \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / educational - programs / doctoral - programs / phd - social - policyqˆXÖ \\x04\\x00\\x00 If you want to combine the disciplinary depth of a PhD in political science or sociology with the multidisciplinary study of social policy issues , the PhD in Social Policy is for you . Depending on your preferred track , you graduate from the program with either a PhD in government and social policy , or a PhD in sociology and social policy . The PhDÂ in Social Policy is defined by its â € œdiscipline - plusâ €\\x9d structure . You will build a strong foundation in either government or sociology before embarking on a sequence of multidisciplinary seminars and advanced research in social policyâ €” all of which will focus primarily on the United States and Western Europe . The joint PhD Programs in Social Policy are fundamentally about research , often in a highly specialized domain . The skills and cross - disciplinary insights you develop will allow you to identify important unanswered questions and create research strategies that improve our understanding of social problems . Our PhD in Social Policy graduates leave the program well equipped to pursue careers in political science or sociology departments at leading colleges and universities , public policy graduate schools , think tanks , nonprofit organizations , and in the public sector .

So , it was no surprise that she decided to study environmental science and public policy as a freshman at Harvard University . What did come as a surprise , however , was how much she enjoyed doing research . â € œWhile working on my college thesis , I got my first taste of fieldwork and learned that sometimes research methods need to be improvised , â €\\x9d Harley said . During a research stint in Egypt where she examined housing expansion and loss of agricultural land , she befriended taxi drivers who introduced her to their local neighborhoods . â € œIt was a random sampling strategy of taxi drivers , â €\\x9d she said . â € œThey were often highly educated , but lacked employment opportunities in their fields . â €\\x9d The drivers - turned - research assistants not only introduced Harley to their communities on the peri - urban fringe of Cairo , but served as translators as well and provided nuanced insights she otherwise would not have gained . This experience got Harley hooked on research , especially the joys and trials of fieldwork . Two years later , she enrolled in the PPOL Program . Harleyâ €™ s doctoral research has taken her to Bangladesh , India , Nepal , and Pakistan to examine agriculture - related technologies . â € œI explore how institutions such as subsidy incentives can drive innovation systems to produce technologies that meet sustainable development goals , â €\\x9d she said . â € œI am particularly interested in how innovation systems can be reoriented through institutional change to meet the needs of poor people . â €\\x9d Harley also took several courses at Harvard Business School ( HBS ) to augment her studies . â € œAs a PhD student you have access to experts across Harvard , which is amazing , â €\\x9d she said . HerÂ Design of Field Research MethodsÂ course withÂ Robin Ely , the Diane Doerge Wilson Professor of Business Administration , pushed Harley to think critically about what makes a good research question , and to then pick the best method to tackle the important questions of interest rather than the other way around . â € œThis is especially important in the field of sustainability science , a field where problem - driven basic research is at its core , â €\\x9d she said . So , whatâ €™ s next for Harley ? After defending her dissertation in September 2016 , she will begin a post - doctoral appointment at Harvard . Further down the line , she hopes to undertake a policy fellowship in Washington , DC to gain a more intimate understanding of how research can inform policy , and eventually , she aims to become a professor . And what advice would Harley give to PPOL PhD candidates ? â € œBe inspired by ourÂ faculty membersÂ and their work , â €\\x9d she said . â € œThe relationship between student and faculty is a powerful part of your experience . Here at Harvard , you get an extraordinary community of scholars to think about your research with . Itâ €™ s an incredible place . â €\\x9d She should know . Sheâ €™ s done her research . q ‹ XL \\x00\\x00\\x00 https :// www . hks . harvard . edu / educational - programs / courses / course - registrationqŒXM \\x06\\x00\\x00 Harvard Kennedy Schoolâ €™ s course registration process consists of four phases : The HKS Office of the Registrar emails faculty members each semester to outlineÂ the specific relevant dates and encourageÂ them to contact the registrar with registration - related questions . Harvard Kennedy School courses are open to : Registration Round I Bidding Students who have selected an oversubscribed class during Registration Round I will receive an email from the HKS Office of the Registrar about the option to bid on the course . Students are given an endowment of points per academic year to use during the bidding process . The endowment is determined by a studentâ €™ s anticipated graduation year and program . Registration Round II Add / Drop and Cross - Registration After registration closes , add / drop and cross - registration begin . A jointly offered course carries an HKS course number and a course number in one or more of the other Harvard schools .
